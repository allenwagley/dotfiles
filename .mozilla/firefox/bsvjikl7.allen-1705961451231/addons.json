If trackers ignore your wishes, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.\n\nBesides automatic tracker blocking, Privacy Badger replaces potentially useful trackers (video players, comments widgets, etc.) with click-to-activate placeholders, and removes outgoing link click tracking on Facebook and Google, with more privacy protections on the way.\n\nTo learn more, see the FAQ on Privacy Badger's homepage.","weeklyDownloads":24080,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"EFF Technologists","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5474073/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/225/225184.png?modified=1622132341","width":1920,"height":1080,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/225/225184.jpg?modified=1622132341","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300,"caption":"Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/171/171793.png?modified=1622132342","width":700,"height":394,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/171/171793.jpg?modified=1622132342","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300,"caption":"Privacy Badger at work on the whitehouse.gov privacy policy page."}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/SupportEFF?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.7962,"reviewCount":452,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/reviews/","updateDate":1701940152000},{"id":"keepassxc-browser@keepassxc.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/917/917354-32.png?modified=1648138451","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/917/917354-64.png?modified=1648138451","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/917/917354-128.png?modified=1648138451"},"name":"KeePassXC-Browser","version":"1.8.12","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4228043/keepassxc_browser-1.8.12.xpi","homepageURL":"https://keepassxc.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/","description":"Official browser plugin for the KeePassXC password manager (https://keepassxc.org).","fullDescription":"Official browser plugin for the KeePassXC password manager (https://keepassxc.org).\n\nThe thing computers can do best is storing information.\nYou shouldn't waste your time trying to remember and type your passwords.\nKeePassXC can store your passwords safely and auto-type them into your everyday websites and applications.","weeklyDownloads":3472,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"KeePassXC Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13036987/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/197/197999.png?modified=1622132902","width":700,"height":198,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/197/197999.jpg?modified=1622132902","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":151,"caption":"KeePassXC"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/234/234592.png?modified=1622132905","width":1513,"height":1047,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/234/234592.jpg?modified=1622132905","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":369,"caption":"Settings page"}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/jbevendorff?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.2562,"reviewCount":237,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/reviews/","updateDate":1706686477000}]}
