Easy on CPU and memory.","fullDescription":"uBlock Origin is not an \"ad blocker\", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature.\n\n***\n\nOut of the box, uBO blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, etc. through the following lists of filters, enabled by default:\n\n- EasyList (ads)\n- EasyPrivacy (tracking)\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list (ads and tracking)\n- Online Malicious URL Blocklist\n- uBO's own lists\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- EasyList Cookie\n- Fanboy Annoyances\n- AdGuard Annoyances\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- And many others\n\nAdditionally, you can point-and-click to block JavaScript locally or globally, create your own global or local rules to override entries from filter lists, and many more advanced features.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\n    Documentation\n    Release notes\n    Community support @ Reddit\n    Contributors @
